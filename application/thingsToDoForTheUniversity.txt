things to do for the university implementation. 

=> create a master developer that will assign the principal and the secretary
    and also the university president and university secretary and will also
    let you enter the name of the school name;

=>  the university secretary should also manage the names of the university 
    departments and assign the courses corelated into that particular departments

=> when the department and the courses is already done. create a batch register
    for the course corriculum
